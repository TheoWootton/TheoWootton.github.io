                <h3>Pros</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The specific type of CO2 that is increasing in earth’s atmosphere can be directly connected to human activity</li>
                        <li>Average temperatures on earth have increased at a rate far faster than can be explained by natural climate changes</li>
                        <li>The rise in atmospheric CO2 over the last century was clearly caused by human activity, as it occurred at a rate much
                        faster than natural climate changes could produce</li>
                        <li>Natural changes in the sun’s activity cannot explain 20th century global warming</li>

                    </ul>

                <h3>Cons</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Many scientists disagree that human activity is primarily responsible for global climate change.</li>
                        <li>Earth’s climate has always warmed and cooled, and the 20th century rise in global temperature is within the bounds of
                        natural temperature fluctuations over the past 3,000 years</li>
                        <li>The rise in atmospheric CO2 over the last century was clearly caused by human activity, as it occurred at a rate much
                        faster than natural climate changes could produce</li>
                        <li>Global warming and cooling are primarily caused by fluctuations in the sun’s heat (solar forcing), not by human activity</li>

                    </ul>
